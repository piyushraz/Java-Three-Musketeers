The goal of this sprint is to implement the exit feature, save feature, fix any existing bugs from sprint 1, and try to implement the best possible move feature as well as create a GUI in the console that can 
easily present all of these features. 

Current Assessment of Team Capacity: We expect to complete the exit and save feature with minimal difficulties. We expect some problems with implementing
the best possible move feature which is why we did not assign too many user stories for this sprint. We also expect to have a cleaner GUI that can present
all of our new features.
