Sprint 1 Group Meeting:

The participants in this meeting are Piyush, Guy, Maryum, and Ayesha. 

Unfinished tasks:<br>
-planning on implementing a best move option using the Greedy Agents minmax algorithm approach<br>
-possibly considering a GUI model somewhere in the game<br>
-implementing an exit feature where there are no winners or losers the game simply ends<br>
-fixing bugs and refactoring code so it adheres to design principles<br>
-updating the randomize board method to not to end the game before the player's turn<br>
<br>
Practices to continue doing for next sprint: <br>
-keep working on our design patterns (possibly adding more patterns)<br>
-implementing features efficiently and helping each other with git problems or implementation<br>
-continuing to give suggestions and reviewing each others code<br>
-updating other team members if any changes occur to the develop branch<br>
<br>
New practices to use for next sprint:<br>
-discussing our work more and adding more features by brainstorming unconventional ideas<br>
-communicating more on discord and planning ahead of time what time to meet virtually and splitting the tasks so everyone is on the same page<br>
<br>
Practices to stop doing for next sprint: <br>
-making branches incorrectly<br>
-using the incorrect names for user stories<br>
<br>
Best experiences during sprint 1: <br>
-implementing functions and getting them to work like randomizing board, skipping turns, making a move log, and creating custom pieces<br>
-more opportunity for creativity and using our own ideas to make the game more fun<br>
-planning and reviewing each others code <br>
-seeing the code come together and work as a whole<br>
<br>
Worst experiences during sprint 1: <br>
-dealing with GitHub pull request and branches<br>
-handling errors resulting from incorrect or premature merging<br>
-handling merge conflicts<br>
